# C-Sharp-Projects
Projects done in C# from Codecademy for a better understanding
(Use "dotnet run" in terminal to execute the programs in appropriate location where the project file is.) 

## [Ceaser Cipher](https://github.com/aditya-tekale-99/C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/Caesar%20Cipher)
An algotihm to encrpt and decrypt a message.  
Every letter of the message will shift three places to the right. For example, A becomes D, B becomes E, C becomes F, and “hello” becomes “khoor”.  
(can change the shifting of places in the algorithm as needed.)

## [Console Creatures](https://github.com/aditya-tekale-99/C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/Console%20Creatures)
A simple algorithm to better understand the WriteLine command in C#  
Printing out ASCII art using WriteLine command in C# 

## [Exquisite Corpse](https://github.com/aditya-tekale-99/C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/Exquisite%20Corpse)
This algorithm is to mimic the Exquisite Corpse game.   
Used methods in C# to randomly combine different parts of ASCII characters so they create a new creature.

## [Mad Libs](https://github.com/aditya-tekale-99/C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/Mad%20Libs)
A Mad Libs word game!   
Mad Libs are short stories with blanks for the player to fill in that represent different parts of speech.   
The end result is a really hilarious and strange story based on what the users chosoe their words to be.  

## [Money Maker](https://github.com/aditya-tekale-99/C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/Money%20Maker)
An algorithm that converts a certain user given amount equivalent to coins.  
There are three types of coins:  
    -A bronze coin is worth 1 cent  
    -A silver coin is worth 5 cents  
    -A gold coin is worth 10 cents  
Example: 9087 coins returns:   
908 Gold coins  
1 Silver coin  
2 Bronze coins  

## [Adventure](https://github.com/aditya-tekale-99/C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/Own%20Adventure)
A adventure game,  Depending on what choices user makes, the program will have a different result.

## [Password Checker](https://github.com/aditya-tekale-99/C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/Password%20Checker)
An algorithm that checks the strength of the password.

## [Programming Languages](https://github.com/aditya-tekale-99/C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/Programming%20Languages)
In this project I used lists and LINQ to search a database for information on programming languages!

## [The Object of Your Affection](https://github.com/aditya-tekale-99/C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/The%20Object%20of%20Your%20Affection)
This project is based on creating a profile and storing the data in a databse for a match making application.



### This projects have helped me in understanding C# better and how the prpogramming language can be implemented using it's various OOP concepts in multiple aspects of IT.
