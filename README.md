# C-Sharp-Projects
Projects done in C# from Codecademy for a better understanding of the syntax   

Use "dotnet run" in terminal to execute the programs. 

## [Ceaser Cipher](https://github.com/aditya-tekale-99/C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/Caesar%20Cipher)
An algotihm to encrpt and decrypt a message.  
Every letter of the message will shift three places to the right. For example, A becomes D, B becomes E, C becomes F, and “hello” becomes “khoor”.  
(can change the shifting of places in the algorithm as needed.)

## [Console Creatures](https://github.com/aditya-tekale-99/C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/Console%20Creatures)
A simple algorithm to better understand the WriteLine command in C#  
Printing out ASCII art using WriteLine command in C# 

## [Exquisite Corpse](https://github.com/aditya-tekale-99/C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/Exquisite%20Corpse)
This algorithm is to mimic the Exquisite Corpse game.   
Used methods in C# to randomly combine different parts of ASCII characters so they create a new creature.

## [Mad Libs](https://github.com/aditya-tekale-99/C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/Mad%20Libs)
A Mad Libs word game!   
Mad Libs are short stories with blanks for the player to fill in that represent different parts of speech.   
The end result is a really hilarious and strange story based on what the users chosoe their words to be.  

## [Money Maker](https://github.com/aditya-tekale-99/C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/Money%20Maker)
